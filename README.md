 I will create  a simple library management system that allows users to add books, borrow, and return books. Books should be represented as objects with properties like title, author, and availability.

 here is what this library management system will look like:

1. Able to  add books to the library.
2. displaying the list of available books.
3. ease  for users to borrow and return books, updating their availability status.
4. Ensure proper validation to handle cases like trying to borrow an unavailable book.
